This repository includes microcode container files for family 15h, 16h,
17h, and 19h AMD CPUs. Microcode patches for families earlier than 15h are
included in the microcode_amd.bin microcode container file. The microcode
patches included in an AMD CPU microcode container file can be listed using
the script in the following git repository:
https://github.com/AMDESE/amd_ucode_info

The microcode patches included in the container files in this directory are
listed below:

NOTE: For Genoa (Family=0x19 Model=0x11) and Bergamo (Family=0x19 Model=0xa0),
either AGESA version >= 1.0.0.8 OR a kernel with the following commit is
required:
a32b0f0db3f3 ("x86/microcode/AMD: Load late on both threads too")

When late loading the patches for Genoa or Bergamo, there may be one spurious
NMI observed per physical core. These NMIs are benign and don't cause any
functional issue but will result in kernel messages being logged.
